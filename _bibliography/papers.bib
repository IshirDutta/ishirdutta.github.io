	abstract = {Emissions of anthropogenic sulfur and nitrogen oxides form secondary pollutants that impact human health, ecosystems, and climate. Accurate estimates of emissions trends are needed to verify the effectiveness of the regulation of these species. We explore the utility of deposition measurements of SOx (=SO2 + SO42−) and TNO3 (=HNO3 + NO3−) as constraints on emissions trends of SOx and NOx in the conterminous United States (CONUS) from 1990 to 2021. The GEOS-Chem model captures observed annual SOx and TNO3 wet deposition at NADP-NTN sites in 2011 with a −15\% and +15\% normalized mean bias (NMB), respectively. The model overestimates the dry deposition of SOx and TNO3 estimated at CASTNET sites in 2011 (NMB {\textgreater}100\%), however, this bias is substantially reduced when using an alternate derived dry deposition data set at the same sites, highlighting the uncertainty in dry deposition velocities. Despite this, we find that the model (driven by scaled NEI emissions) captures the relative trend in dry deposition of SOx (−93\% observed and −94\% simulated) and TNO3 (−66\% observed and −68\% simulated) from 1990 to 2021 and that these decreases closely reflect the trends in anthropogenic SO2 emissions (−93\%) and anthropogenic NOx emissions (−71\%), respectively. SOx and TNO3 wet deposition observations are dominated by soluble secondary products and are more influenced by natural and transboundary sources, and therefore have decreased more modestly over the same period (−78\% and −52\%). Natural sources of NOx are relatively constant during this time and therefore moderate the reduction in total NOx emissions (−55\%).},

	abstract = {A reference or “no-feedback” radiative response to warming is fundamental to understanding how much global warming will occur for a given change in greenhouse gases or solar radiation incident on the Earth. The simplest estimate of this radiative response is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law as W m−2 K−1 for Earth's present climate, where is a global effective emission temperature. The comparable radiative response in climate models, widely called the “Planck feedback,” averages −3.3 W m−2 K−1. This difference of 0.5 W m−2 K−1 is large compared to the uncertainty in the net climate feedback, yet it has not been studied carefully. We use radiative transfer models to analyze these two radiative feedbacks to warming, and find that the difference arises primarily from the lack of stratospheric warming assumed in calculations of the Planck feedback (traditionally justified by differing constraints on and time scales of stratospheric adjustment relative to surface and tropospheric warming). The Planck feedback is thus masked for wavelengths with non-negligible stratospheric opacity, and this effect implicitly acts to amplify warming in current feedback analysis of climate change. Other differences between Planck and Stefan-Boltzmann feedbacks arise from temperature-dependent gas opacities, and several artifacts of nonlinear averaging across wavelengths, heights, and different locations; these effects partly cancel but as a whole slightly destabilize the Planck feedback. Our results point to an important role played by stratospheric opacity in Earth's climate sensitivity, and clarify a long-overlooked but notable gap in our understanding of Earth's reference radiative response to warming.},

	abstract = {Nano-sized particles in wastewater are generally considered colloids, but their production and size distribution are not well understood. Organic nano-sized particles are more abundant than engineered nanomaterials in wastewater, where they may cause membrane fouling, harbor pathogens, and transport contaminants to the environment. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the seasonal behavior, removal, and the quantity and size of suspended particles (both unfiltered and filtered through a 450 nm filter) at multiple points within different processes along two water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs, formerly wastewater treatment plants). In Southern California where wastewater is often reused or reclaimed, a better understanding of nano-sized particles generation and removal may help reduce cost. We found that both types of the biological secondary treatments investigated (conventional activated sludge process and trickling filter) were more efficient in removing suspended particles larger than 450 nm than they were smaller ones. However, the results show that current treatment processes are not designed to remove nano-sized particles efficiently. We also investigated the factors that correlate with their occurrence and found that there was a significant and direct correlation between influent dissolved chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the abundance of suspended particles both larger and smaller than 450 nm, suggesting that the suspended particles increased with dissolved COD in the WRRFs and thus were biogenically generated during the wastewater treatment. Although no conclusive seasonal correlations were found, dissolved COD management may control nano-sized particle production. Practitioner Points Conventional secondary treatments (activated sludge and trickling filter) could efficiently remove particles but not as efficiently for nano-sized particles (40.1–52.7\% removal). At one facility, particles of all sizes were found to correlate with dissolved carbon and EPS, meaning they were biogenic. Monitoring dissolved carbon or EPS precursors may help control membrane fouling post-secondary treatment, and this warrants more studies.},

	abstract = {The polarization of light can exhibit unusual features when singular optical beams are involved. In 3-dimensional polarized random media the polarization orientation around singularities describe 1/2 or 3/2 Möbius strips. It has been predicted that if singular beams intersect non-collinearly in free space, the polarization ellipse rotates forming many-turn Möbius strips or twisted ribbons along closed loops around a central singularity. These polarization features are important because polarization is an aspect of light that mediate strong interactions with matter, with potential for new applications. We examined the non-collinear superposition of two unfocused paraxial light beams when one of them carried an optical vortex and the other one a uniform phase front, both in orthogonal states of circular polarization. It is known that these superpositions in 2-dimensions produce space-variant patterns of polarization. Relying on the symmetry of the problem, we extracted the 3-dimensional patterns from projective measurements, and confirmed the formation of many-turn Möbius strips or twisted ribbons when the topological charge of one of the component beams was odd or even, respectively. The measurements agree well with the modelings and confirmed that these types of patterns occur at macroscopic length scales and in ordinary superposition situations.},
